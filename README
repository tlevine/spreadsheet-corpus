I find file-based spreadsheets and web-based spreadsheets.

For file-based spreadsheets, I look for fully qualified
URLs, relative URLs, and filenames in query strings.
I look for filenames that end in any of the following extensions.

* gnumeric
* xlsx
* xls
* ods
* csv

The following web-based spreadsheets are supported.

* Google Spreadsheets
* Microsoft Excel Online
